# 🚀 Backend Web Development Project

Welcome to my **backend web development** project built with **Node.js** and **Express**! This project demonstrates user registration, authentication, and dynamic content management with a focus on simplicity and security.

## 🛠️ Features:

🔒 **User Authentication**:
   - Register with a unique username and password.
   - Passwords are **hashed** with **bcrypt** for security.
   - Authentication via **JWT tokens** (stored in cookies) to manage user sessions.

📚 **Dynamic Content**:
   - Create, edit, and delete blog posts.
   - Post data is stored in a **SQLite** database.
   - Markdown support: posts are rendered with **marked** and sanitized with **sanitize-html**.

🌐 **Views**:
   - Uses **EJS** for dynamic HTML rendering.

📝 **Validation**:
   - Ensures input like usernames, passwords, and post content follow rules (e.g., username length, password strength).

💅 **Frontend Styling**:
   - Minimal and responsive design using **SimpleCSS**.

🔒 **Security**:
   - Sanitizes user input to avoid XSS vulnerabilities.
   - Hashes passwords and uses **JWT tokens** for authentication.

## 🚀 How It Works:

1.  **User Registration**:
    -   Register with a **username** and **password**.
    -   Passwords are hashed and stored in the database.
    -   A **JWT token** is sent to the user's browser for authentication.

2.  **User Login**:
    -   Log in using the **username** and **password**.
    -   **JWT tokens** are used to validate the session.

3.  **Post Management**:
    -   Create, edit, or delete posts.
    -   Posts are rendered with **markdown** support.

4.  **Views**:
    -   **EJS** renders dynamic content, including the homepage, single posts, and the dashboard.

## 📥 Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/molii566/blog-post-web-backend.git](https://github.com/molii566/blog-post-web-backend.git)
    cd blog-post-web-backend
    ```

2.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

4.  Make sure you have a `.env` file with the following content:

    ```
    JWTSECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_here
    ```

## 🖥️ Project Structure

-   **`server.js`**: Main server file with route handlers, authentication, and post management.
-   **`/views`**: Contains EJS files for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
-   **`/public`**: Static assets like styles and images.
-   **`/db`**: SQLite database with user and post tables.
-   **`/node_modules`**: Dependencies installed via npm.

## 🚨 Security Features:

-   **JWT Authentication**: User sessions are managed with **JWT tokens** stored in cookies.
-   **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using **bcrypt** before being saved in the database.
-   **Input Validation & Sanitization**: User input is validated and sanitized to prevent malicious content and security vulnerabilities.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:

-   Node.js and Express for server-side logic.
-   SQLite for database management.
-   bcrypt for password hashing.
-   jsonwebtoken for JWT authentication.
-   marked and sanitize-html for rendering and sanitizing markdown content.
-   EJS for templating and rendering views.
